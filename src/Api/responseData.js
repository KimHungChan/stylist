And although millennials are <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/800650/group-chat-functions-age-use-text-online-messaging-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">much more likely</a> than older generations to use group chats, this seems unlikely to alleviate loneliness: in fact, 16-35 year olds are the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/articles/lonelinesswhatcharacteristicsandcircumstancesareassociatedwithfeelinglonely/2018-04-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">loneliest age group</a> of all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While there is <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/news/lifestyle-and-exercise/does-social-media-make-people-isolated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">little solid evidence </a>to support the oft-made claim that social media and digital communications increase isolation, it certainly seems that they are doing little to mitigate a thriving phenomenon. But how responsible is our reliance on group chats for this sense of seclusion?\n\t  </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not group chats that are the problem\u2014 it\u2019s when group chats are overused,\u201d says clinical psychologist and author of <i><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Key-Calm-Linda-Blair/dp/1444765345" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Key to Calm</a></i>, Linda Blair. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of misunderstanding around group chats.

Real friendships tend to thrive in the spaces between the good times, in the places that jokes and gossip and the lightness of the group chat don\u2019t touch. Friendships are maintained in messaging someone you love individually, and truly engaging with the parts of their life not shared in a comparatively public space.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When we can sit back and watch our friendship groups thrive without throwing in more than the odd laughing face emoji, it becomes easy to maintain a sense of closeness without investing the time or effort needed to create truly rewarding relationships.\u00a0\n\t  </p>\n<p>But it\u2019s clear that group chats aren\u2019t going anywhere, so what can we do to maintain our relationships?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMake group chats a means of getting connected, not something you rely on to feel connected,\u201d advises Blair. \u201cIn order to feel secure and safe, human beings react in a part of the brain called the fear centre. This part of the brain is so primitive that it doesn\u2019t react to anything other than real-life interaction\u2026 If you are overly reliant on devices all the time, you never truly get that sense of belonging.\u201d</p>\n",
