# Getting Started with Stylist App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Techniques used

- [scss](https://sass-lang.com/) to style the components
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/docs) to make passing props to css easier
- [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for testing along with Jest
- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) for making requests
- [react router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) for creating routes

## Thoughts

I just added a few tests to show generally how I would go about testing. There's a lot more you can do with time but there's not too much intractability on this page to test anyway.

In terms of styling I just went with the original style but not to a pixel perfect level of detail. The page should be fairly responsive and readable for even the smallest of mobile screens. A hamburger menu would have helped with the navbar if I had more time. I also would have liked to have added a dark theme.

**_Overall it was a very enjoyable exercise, hopefully you like it and thanks for taking it time to consider my application!_**
